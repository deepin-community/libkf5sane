 Working Group disclaims all warranties in the TWAIN toolkit whether
 implied, express or statutory, including, without limitation, the
 implied warranties of merchantability, noninfringement of third party
 rights and fitness for a particular purpose. The TWAIN Working Group
 disclaims all liability for damages, whether direct, indirect,
 special, incidental, or consequential, arising from the reproduction,
 distribution, modification, or other use of the TWAIN Toolkit.
 .
 As a condition of this license, Customer agrees to include in software
 programs based in whole or in part on the TWAIN Toolkit the following
 providions in (i) the header or similar file in such software and (ii)
 prominently in its documentation and to require its sublicensees to
 include these provisions in similar locations: The TWAIN Toolkit is
 distributed as is. The developer and distributors of the TWAIN Toolkit
 expressly disclaim all implied, express or statutory warranties
 including, without limitation, the implied warranties of
 merchantability, noninfringement of third party rights and fitness for
 a particular purpose. Neither the developers nor the distributors will
 be liable for damages, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental,
